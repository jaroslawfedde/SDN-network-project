# SDN-network-project
  SDN network design made with GNS3. The essence of the project was to present the main functionalities of Open vSwitch (OpenFlow, LACP, L3, VLAN).  The materials contained in the repository take the form of screenshots and instructions. Everything you need to recreate the project is included in this file, enjoy :)
  The created infrastructure is shown below:

  The structure of the presented network consists of two parts. The first one is located at the top (marked with a yellow line) and represent the controller and application plane. It consists of two virtual machines, Cisco switch, NAT cloud and management interfaces (eth0) belonging to two OVS switches. All the listed items belongs to one subnet (192.168.122.0), where the role of the DHCP server is played by the NAT Cloud. The heart of this plane is the ODL / OFM server, which includes an installed controller (OpenDaylight) and an application (OpenFlow Manager). After the left side is a virtual machine with a simple Linux Lite graphics system, which will facilitate network management using a web browser. 
  The other part is a managed network with two at the center Open vSwitch switches. They are fully synchronized with the controller, unlike the rest of the devices (such as end stations or routers) that setup is mainly done directly. On the left the website has a simple simulated computer (VPCS) and a server containing two NIC's. Both devices are separated from the rest by creating a separate bridge on the switch. They are intended to present an example of the link aggregation  from using the LACP protocol. On the right is another OVS switch that unlike the "colleagues" in the center, it is not connected to controller. Its task is to present another OVS functionality that it's  routing. In the very center, two VLANs were created, in which the composition includes Cisco router, VPCS and Ubuntu Docker Guest (light server).
  Both planes must be separated from each other, therefore on both switches there is no routing configured. This is because, interfaces eth0 of the switches are management-only interfaces. If we however, they ignored this fact, there would be collision of TCP frames with OpenFlow frames, which paralyzes remote management of the SDN network. The switches therefore work in the second layer. In a situation where any of the devices needed internet connection, user can use R5 router which supports NAT translations. Consequently, the guest systems do not have to be on the same subnets as the NAT cloud, it can use a defined pool of public addresses.

First, we need to install a virtualization environment (VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Pro) and GNS3 with GNS3 VM. In my case, all machines were run on VirtualBox (ODL/OFM server, LinuxLite, Debian LACP) with the exception of GNS3 VM, which was run on VMware. The rest of devices such as Cisco routers (7200), switches (OVS, IOU), VPCSs and Dockers will be hosted by GNS3 VM.
